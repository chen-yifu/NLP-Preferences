Over here in Europe we've seen the continent steadily getting closed down. I'm not going in to specifics about preventative measures taken per country, these things change from day to day. Please check your local subreddit or the /r/Coronavirus subreddit.\n\nIn general, people with MS are considered vulnerable, especially those on specific DMT's. The first cases of people on DMT who contracted COVID-19 are promising, but it is always better to not get it at all. **So wash your hands, stay home as much as you can and keep your distance.**\n\nI'm doing better after a tense and scary week in which I was preoccupied with not falling apart while taking care of my 5yo so my husband could work. I'm still not coping well, but I had a good cry this morning about how it all sucks, and that worked wonders (for today anyway). So here are some new helpful links:\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mscovid19) #MSCOVID19 about people w/MS who contracted COVID-19\n\n~~~\n\n[MS International Federation](https://www.msif.org/news/2020/02/10/the-coronavirus-and-ms-what-you-need-to-know/) on COVID-19, this site includes translations and links to local MS organisations\n\n*Recommendations from the MS International Federation:*\n\n* People with MS currently taking DMTs continue with their treatment.  \n* People who develop symptoms of COVID-19 or test positive for the infection discuss their MS therapies with their MS care provider or another health care professional who is familiar with their care.  \n* Before starting on any new DMT, people with MS discuss with their healthcare professional which therapy is the best choice for their individual disease course and disease activity in light of COVID-19 risk in the region.  \n* Those who are due to start on a DMT but have not yet done so, should consider selecting a treatment that does not reduce specific immune cells (lymphocytes). Examples include: interferons, glatiramer acetate, or natalizumab. Medications that reduce lymphocytes over longer intervals include alemtuzumab, cladribine, ocrelizumab and rituximab.  \n* The following oral DMTs may reduce the ability of the immune system to respond to an infection: fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide and siponimod. People should carefully consider the risks and benefits of initiating these treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n* People with MS who are currently taking alemtuzumab, cladribine, ocrelizumab, rituximab, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide or siponimod and are living in a community with a COVID-19 outbreak should isolate as much as possible to reduce their risk of infection.\n\n~~~\n\nA possible connection between the use of NSAID's and worsening of symptoms of COVID-19 [has been found](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2213-2600%2820%2930116-8).

If I made the call now, it would be different for sure. I went with Ocrevus as it's an infusion every six months and is very strong. Copaxone is very low on side effects but not as strong. When I started meds Ocrevus wasn't covered in Alberta as a first line med (you'd had to be on something else and then relapse to get it covered). That changed in April last year, so as soon as that changed I switched to Ocrevus. There are a couple philosophies with MS - one is start with the least intrusive med (Copaxone) and work your way up if you relapse. This is an older mindset and the risk is you relapse and have irreversible damage. The newer thinking is to start aggressive (Ocrevus) as damage from relapses can be permanent.

No need to bold text or be so emphatic about it-- we didn't miss it, we heard it loud and clear. \n\n\nIt isn't just *over* when a loved one dies. Especially if you were their caregiver. Getting support from people who understand what your loved one went through and by proxy, some of what you went through being by their side is probably a huge comfort for folks who have lost others to MS. Of course they would want to come here for a sense of connection and comfort because other people don't understand that particular brand of hell the way we do. \n\nI understand what you are saying, that it's hard to read that someone with MS died. But I think part of getting through the adjustment to living with MS is making peace with that. It's part of what we deal with having this disease. Putting your discomfort with that on other people and trying to make it theirs to manage for you is not the way to get past it. Turning away caregivers looking for support here because it makes you uncomfortable is unfair to the people who sacrificed a lot to look after a loved one. \n\n\nDMT's have really come a long way for sure, but there are still plenty of people who have lost a lot to this disease. It feels pretty egocentric to say 'it probably won't ever happen to me so I don't want to hear about it.' You are very fortunate. Privileged. Don't pull the ladder up just because you got yours.

It really depends on what your symptoms are, but for me on a bad day I walk really slow and my legs start buckling beneath me. Because people know and understand they walk slower without questioning, and aren't asking me what's up. My employer has made provisions like allowing me to park closer so I don't have as far to walk. \n\nMuch of our society is designed around talking and comunicating. All good things start with a discussion, and you can't expect your friends and family to understand or support you if you don't tell them about it. It is scary, really scary and believe me I know how it seems much more real when you have to say those words to someone. But if you are anything like me (and it sounds it from what you have said) you are more scared of their reaction than you are of MS. Unless your parents have been known to be really unsupportive in the past, or irrational in their thought processes, they can't and won't blame you for something that is not your fault. This is a lifelong illness that is now a part of your life, and there will be times when you need people to support you, equip them with the knowledge to do so to the best of their abilities.\n\nEveryone has their own way of telling people, I simply said to people 'you know I have been walking slowly and the doctors didn't know why? Well I had another MRI scan and they found another lesion in my brain, and have diagnosed it as MS.' If their face falls and they look at me like I have told them I am going to die tomorrow I reassure them that it is not the same as it was 10 years ago, and there have been big improvements to the treatments available. A lot of people's understanding of MS is based on things they heard/saw years and years ago, and like most things the worst cases are most talked about.  \n\n\nWith that said, it *is* entirely up to you, it is your body and you have autonomoy over it. You do however *have* to inform your car insurance company and DVLA if you are in the UK. With regards to your children, they will pick up that something is wrong, so you may want to think about what to say. People worry that you shouldn't tell children things to 'protect' them, but really they are sponges for information, and at some point will want to know why mummy cant do something or needs help doing something else. I would use it as an opportunity to teach them that not all people are able to do things, and the importance of helping others. If you tell one lie by omission, you will have to tell a thousand other lies to cover that original lie and that is exhausting.

Michigan.  But I believe it is federally funded.  So it should be all over it might be called the department of aging.  It provides an aide or if there is someone you know that you trust to come in they often will direct pay them (its not a lot about 10/12 hr. but its a nice option to have.  If your mom was part of a church etc. they will often have volunteers even if it is a few hours etc.  The area agency on aging will send a social worker to your house (let them know about the MS) and they will offer services like taking your mom out for coffee/breakfast or cooking for her doing meal prep, lunch prep, help with feeding etc.  They can also help arrange a medical aide to come to the house to give baths/showers.  Don't be shy about asking for help, the more you ask for the more hours you will get if she qualifies.  You can set the hours up.  I would have someone come in the morning and get my mom up and moving then come back for lunch or stay from 8-12 then I would get home at 5.  If your mom was in the service there is also help there as well.  Now the other thing you can do is purchase a WYZE camera for 20 bucks online thru the company or amazon.  It can be your 'security' because you can watch from your phone and even let them know that you have the camera because you were watching your mom prior with it.  Sometimes the agency will use different home care agencies.  The one that I liked is that they had to call from my home phone to ensure that they were showing up as a timecard.  But now a lot of people don't have them.  The agency can also help your mom get a free 'I have fallen and can't get up' necklace and the machine.  They can also help you with bars etc for your bathroom.  Don't be afraid to reach out to her primary doc as well and ask for them to write for services from her insurance (PT/OT etc.) it helps having people coming to give a hand.

Diagnosed almost two years ago, I\u2019ve been on Copaxone and Gilenya. Both of which i experienced worsening of ms and accumulated more lesions. While in the process of switching to Gilenya a year ago, i had a lapse in my insurance. After months on end of trying to get it resolved I had finally gotten insured and was on track for Ocrevus. But then, in January of this year i was hospitalized and received steroids because i couldn\u2019t feel my legs. That delayed my scheduled mris for another month. It\u2019s now late March, I\u2019ve gotten back my mri results which show more progression and new active lesions. I\u2019ve been denied for Ocrevus twice and now there\u2019s a global pandemic. \n\nI decided that i was going to take off work to reduce my risk of exposure to Covid-19, that was until i got a notice from my leasing office that there was no exceptions for late rent for April payments. \n\nI then got the call that I\u2019m approved for ocrevus!\n\nWhile exciting news after a year long wait, i am now in a difficult situation. My MS has progressed a lot this past year, i need treatment now. If i get my first infusion next week, my doctor insisted i stay out of work for at least a month. That means i would have to again have a conversation with my employers that i can\u2019t work for at least a month.

I'm not a doctor, so obviously your neuro knows what is right for you...that said, I'm asking because with a lot of drugs the 'dose' matters dramatically, especially for side effects due to off-target toxicities. Antibody therapies, like Ocrevus and Rituxan, are a bit different. They are exquisitely selective and really only interact with the one thing they were designed for - in this case, the CD20 receptor. The goal with both Rituxan and Ocrevus is to deplete you of B cells.

But after talking with a nurse-practitioner I now have 2 months of medicines that I need.\n\nThe reason for this *good government thinking ahead* is that the VA hospital knows they are going into 'battle mode' and will be swamped with sick Covid-19 patients.\n\nAs of last week St Louis only had a couple of Covid-19 patients ID'ed at the airport. The VA nurse told me that as soon as they detected a single Covid-19 patient in the general population of St Louis the hospital would close/restrict their doors and every person entering the hospital would have their temperatures checked, be asked questions and examined before being allowed inside the hospital.\n\nIn short, the VA is getting ready for the sh*t to hit the proverbial fan.\n\nWhile our president has delayed and wasted precious time, and now spins and sometimes tells outright lies from DC, other parts of our federal gov't are planning logically and thinking ahead -- remember that in the upcoming weeks.\n\nAs of today there are 10+ cases of Covid-19 in St Louis. Thus, I'm assuming that VA hospital is in lockdown mode.\n\nOh and my T-shirt says:\n\n> If I knew I was going to live this long I would have taken better care of myself\n\nConsider that unasked-for-advice to younger MSers, coming from a 50-something guy who has had diagnosed MS for 30+ years and whose first attack left me blind as a bat and unable to walk for about a week.", "forum_name":"r/MultipleSclerosis", "forum_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/", "forum_user_count":"15537", "forum_activity_count":"23504", "forum_disease_name":"multiple sclerosis", "opinion_word_name":"true", "opinion_word_polarity":"0.91", "author_username":"IntnsRed", "author_forum_name":"r/MultipleSclerosis", "author_member_since":"", "author_post_count":"", "author_score":"", "author_flair":"50sM / RRMS / Dx1987 / Ocrevus", "author_age":"50", "author_gender":"unknown", "author_country":"", "author_bio":"", "author_profile_url":"http://reddit.com/user/IntnsRed"},

While I don't feel like I am emotionally ready to dive deep into research (or physically, given my vision issues), I have done a little and wanted to run it by others to hear your experiences.\n\nTREATMENTS\n\nThe doctors told me (and it is my understanding) that any long-term information out there on MS is rather inaccurate at this point. Since most new medications have appeared in the last 10-15 years, there has not been enough time to determine their effect on late MS. My current understanding is that during the first few years, I may have a few relapses as my medications get dialed in, and then from there it is smooth sailing and relatively symptom free. Is that accurate? For those of you who have had it a long time or have learned a lot about the medications out there, what have you learned/observed and what can I expect? On that note, what is considered a low vs high number of lesions among those with MS? I suppose I am up to 4 now.\n\nSYMPTOMS/ACTIVITY\n\nSince MS affects the nervous system, it seems like anything is on the table. Physical limitations are inconvenient, but the thought of being cognitively impaired scares me far more. Something I have experienced (unsure if mine was MS-related at the time) is brain fog (cog-fog) and I have read that it is certainly something that can arise from MS. My bouts with cog-fog can be debilitating in the way severe depression is, where I feel emotionally and cognitively detached. I am a fairly ambitious person with a strong career drive, so the thought of not being able to access my mind for weeks at a time is hard to accept. I also find it hard to explain to those around me what it feels like, and how debilitating it really is. I really would like to know more about how many of you have had to deal with cog-fog from MS, how often/severe it is, and if you have any effective ways to manage or mitigate it. I have read that  diet and exercise is important, but the specifics seem to be inconsistent.\n\nPERSONAL HEALTH AND PREVENTION\n\nIf anything is clear after being in this for a week, its that maintaining a healthy lifestyle is paramount to minimizing the affects of MS. I don't know exactly what my triggers are yet, but I am fairly confident that sleep deprivation would be one of them. Its not realistic to build good lifestyle habits all at once, so I decided to start with a consistent sleep pattern (9:30pm - 6:00am) that I can stick with regardless of the job I have. I figured from there that I would start building in daily exercise (especially yoga) and a good diet. Beyond sleep, exercise, and diet, what have you all found to be important and in what quantities? I have heard that things like Vitamin D deficiency can be a big trigger, and I would also be curious to know how much you can deviate from your daily norm before you trigger symptoms. Is it realistic to have a late night out on occasion? Can I miss a day of exercise, or eat like crap for a week on vacation? How much flexibility is realistic?\n\nI know I am kind of just dumping my thoughts here and asking vague questions, but its a lot to process and I don't know where to begin. I have begun to read the Wahls Protocol and reach out to family friends that know people with MS, but its a huge fire hose of information. Some guidance about where to start, as well as some thoughts to my particular concerns above would be appreciated. Thanks for your time.\n\nTL;DR - Just got diagnosed with MS last week at age 27.

And I wanted to share my story. March 16th is exactly one year since I was diagnosed with MS. It's been a terrible, difficult year. \nIt all started at the end of 2018, I had constant fatigue, spasms and muscular fasciculations, things were falling out of my hands and I didn't have the motor precision I used to have. Until I started having nystagmus and one morning I woke up with part of my visual field absent. \nI immediately went to the hospital. After an MRI they found the typical scars, and when asked by the doctors if there are any diseases in the family I mentioned that not even a month before my cousin was found with multiple sclerosis. After an LP, the diagnosis. \nI had a terrible fear and I was in my last semester of college. I was about to give it all up. \nBut I managed to finish my engineering studies with excellent results. But I hadn't started therapy yet. \nA lot of jobs were offered to me, but I had to give up everything because of the uncertainties of the disease and the therapy I was supposed to start.\nAfter finishing my studies I had to perform a new MRI, and they found other lesions. From there I started with Plegridy, the interferon that you inject yourself with every two weeks.\nFor three months, I was miserable. Every dose made me sick for a week and a half. I was suffering from depression, as a very sociable person, I locked myself up at home, and I didn't want to have contact with anyone else. \nAt a certain point I realized that things couldn't go on like this. I asked the MS Society for help, and I did activities to get to know other people with the same problem. They taught me how to understand the disease and how to manage it, to coordinate my commitments with the therapy. I started to share my situation with friends and many other people, who helped and supported me. In doing so, I also found out about the disease in other friends of mine who contacted me in private to talk about it. \nI felt understood and supported. \nNow I feel much better, the disease often comes out and reminds me she\u2019s still there (i need to find a weird name for her), and the therapy is still heavy, but I started working, enjoying life, going out and having fun with friends, I have hobbies again and fun! \nI'm very happy to have taken all these huge steps in a year,\nI wanted to ask you, how did it go, did you accept it? How's it going with the medication? How did you find out? \nGreets\nAle", "forum_name":"r/MultipleSclerosis", "forum_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/", "forum_user_count":"15537", "forum_activity_count":"23504", "forum_disease_name":"multiple sclerosis", "opinion_word_name":"sick", "opinion_word_polarity":"-1.00", "author_username":"Pewdie9YoArmy", "author_forum_name":"r/MultipleSclerosis", "author_member_since":"", "author_post_count":"", "author_score":"", "author_flair":"None", "author_age":"0", "author_gender":"unknown", "author_country":"", "author_bio":"", "author_profile_url":"http://reddit.com/user/Pewdie9YoArmy"},

I'm a bit worried she won't get the best treatment possible. \n\nI'm concerned that because her symptoms are severe at the moment and she can't use her left hand (spreading to right hand) that \nA) we don't know if she will regain mobility/strength as symptoms are just getting worse 3.5 weeks after appearing and B) if we don't go on the strongest drug like Mavenclad then there would be more chance of a further relapse and thus a further chance of a potentially life long disability. The doctors don't really care if you permanently lose function in your body and it affects you long term, they're more worried about the short term risk and lessening the Covid-19 threat.", "forum_name":"r/MultipleSclerosis", "forum_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/", "forum_user_count":"15537", "forum_activity_count":"23504", "forum_disease_name":"multiple sclerosis", "opinion_word_name":"relapse", "opinion_word_polarity":"-1.00", "author_username":"LeanBauer", "author_forum_name":"r/MultipleSclerosis", "author_member_since":"", "author_post_count":"", "author_score":"", "author_flair":"None", "author_age":"0", "author_gender":"unknown", "author_country":"", "author_bio":"", "author_profile_url":"http://reddit.com/user/LeanBauer"},

They are scams designed to give money, publicity, or both to the promoting organisations! The 'research' behind these fad diets are often heavily biased, incomplete, or make completely irrational assumptions.\n\nThe key facts to remember, backed by actual science:\n\n1. Take your doctor prescribed DMT.\n\n2. Take as much exercise as is possible while still being comfortable for you.\n\n3. Eat a balanced and full diet that gives you all the recommended amounts of all vitamins, minerals etc...\n\n4. Do nothing to your regimen without speaking to a qualified neurologist.\n\nDiets can actually be harmful by depriving you of everything your body needs, and when they are as untested as Wahl's and others, that can be very dangerous.\n\nIf you don't believe me, and you shouldn't without reason, here are 3 citations:\n\nThe National MS Society:\n\n>Different diets have been proposed as treatments, or even cures, for the signs and symptoms of MS.
